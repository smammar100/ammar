            I grew up in a small town in central Pennsylvania called Hollidaysburg. Yes, it&apos;s real.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wasn&apos;t one of those kids with a clear plan for what I wanted to be, but what I did have was a pretty strong instinct for what made me feel alive. In high school, that was choir, a cappella, and eventually musical theater. In college, it was philosophy, studying abroad in Spain and Chile, and performing music and theater whenever I could.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking back, the arts were never really a side interest. They were the place I learned what it felt like to make something from nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since then, my life has been less of a straight line and more of a series of intuitive turns. I went into advertising because I was curious about creativity and business. I left it because I wanted to be closer to building things. I learned to code because I wanted a practical craft that could open doors. I moved into design because I cared more about the experience than the implementation details.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the outside, that might look like a bunch of pivots. From the inside, it felt more like following the energy from one room to the next. I&apos;ve moved cities, changed disciplines, been confused, been lucky, been humbled, and had to rebuild my confidence more than once. But the winding parts have usually been where the good material is.
          </p>
          <p>
            These days, I live in Los Angeles. I design software, write about creativity and technology, and keep trying to build a life where the different parts of me get to talk to each other. That might be the simplest way to understand me: I&apos;m always looking for the thread between the practical and the creative, the analytical and the emotional, the craft and the person doing the work.
          </p>
          <p>

            The name comes from the ancient story of Daedalus, who used his creativity to invent a way out of the labyrinth. I like that image because it feels close to the work I&apos;m trying to do: looking for paths through today&apos;s creative maze and paying attention to what those paths reveal about the future.
